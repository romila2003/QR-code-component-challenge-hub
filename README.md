## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VSCode

### What I learned

This is my first challenge on Frontend Mentor and I have improved on my ability to copy a ui design into code. Despite this being an easy challenge, I have learnt a lot with arranging the image inside the box and making sure the outcome looks identical to the image/challenge. I am more comfortable with writing code for HTML and am slightly comfortable with CSS however there is much more room improvements, in the near future.


### Continued development

I intend to learn responsive websites and improve my knowledge of Javascript for future projects. For this particular project, I recognised that I need to improve my knowledge of the padding properties rather than researching about this topic.


### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/] - This helped me for basic concepts such as the display property and making sure I align the elements to the right property. I really liked this website and often use it for specific concepts, when I forget or want to reassure myself.
